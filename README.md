## 💡 About the project

| **Program name** | cub3D |
|------------------|-----------|
| **Turn in files**| All your files |
| **Makefile**     | all, clean, fclean, re, bonus |
| **Arguments**    | a map in format *.cub |
| **External functions** | open, close, read, write, printf, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit + All functions of the math library (-lm man man 3 math) + All functions of the MinilibX |
| **Libft authorized** | Yes |
| **Description**  | You must create a “realistic” 3D graphical representation of the inside of a maze from a first-person perspective. You have to create this representation using the Ray-Casting principles mentioned earlier. |



✅ You must use the miniLibX. Either the version that is available on the operating
system, or from its sources. If you choose to work with the sources, you will
need to apply the same rules for your libft as those written above in Common
Instructions part.

✅ The management of your window must remain smooth: changing to another window,
minimizing, etc.

✅ Display different wall textures (the choice is yours) that vary depending on which
side the wall is facing (North, South, East, West).

Your program must be able to set the floor and ceiling colors to two different ones.

• The program displays the image in a window and respects the following rules:

✅ The left and right arrow keys of the keyboard must allow you to look left and
right in the maze.

✅ The W, A, S, and D keys must allow you to move the point of view through
the maze.

✅ Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.

✅ Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and
quit the program cleanly.

✅ The use of images of the minilibX is strongly recommended.

• Your program must take as a first argument a scene description file with the .cub
extension.

◦ The map must be composed of only 6 possible characters: 0 for an empty space,
1 for a wall, and N,S,E or W for the player’s start position and spawning
orientation.
The map must be closed/surrounded by walls, if not the program must return
an error.

◦ Except for the map content, each type of element can be separated by one or
more empty line(s).

◦ Except for the map content which always has to be the last, each type of
element can be set in any order in the file.

◦ Except for the map, each type of information from an element can be separated
by one or more space(s).

◦ The map must be parsed as it looks in the file. Spaces are a valid part of the
map and are up to you to handle. You must be able to parse any kind of map,
as long as it respects the rules of the map.

Each element (except the map) firsts information is the type identifier (composed
by one or two character(s)), followed by all specific informations for each
object in a strict order such as :

∗ North texture:

	NO ./path_to_the_north_texture
-  identifier: NO 

- path to the north texure

∗ South texture:

	SO ./path_to_the_south_texture
- identifier: SO
- path to the south texure
- 
∗ West texture:

	WE ./path_to_the_west_texture
- identifier: WE
- path to the west texure
- 
∗ East texture:
	
	EA ./path_to_the_east_texture
- identifier: EA
- path to the east texure
- 
∗ Floor color:

	F 220,100,0
- identifier: F
- R,G,B colors in range [0,255]: 0, 255, 255

Ceiling color:
	
	C 225,30,0
- identifier: C
- R,G,B colors in range [0,255]: 0, 255, 255

- Example of the mandatory part with a minimalist .cub scene:

		NO ./path_to_the_north_texture
		SO ./path_to_the_south_texture
		WE ./path_to_the_west_texture
		EA ./path_to_the_east_texture
		F 220,100,0
		C 225,30,0

-  If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program
must exit properly and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message
of your choice.
